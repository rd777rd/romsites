        <p class="processDescription">The first step in our web design process is Discovery and Research. We begin by understanding your business, target audience, and goals. This involves in-depth discussions and research to gather all necessary information and inspiration.
            <br/>
            Next, we move on to Wireframing and Prototyping. We create wireframes and prototypes using tools like Figma to visualize the layout and structure of your website. This phase includes feedback and revisions to ensure alignment with your vision.
            <br/>
            The third step is Design Execution. Our designers craft high-fidelity designs, focusing on aesthetics, user experience, and responsiveness. This step includes multiple iterations and refinements based on your input.
            <br/>
            Finally, we proceed with Approval and Handoff. Once the design is finalized and approved, we prepare all design assets for handoff to the development team, ensuring a seamless transition.</p>
